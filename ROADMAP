Erlunit 0.2 - ROADMAP


Mail hd2010@eonblast.com with requests. No promisses:


0.3 - make checks beyond equal and not_equal operational:
      true, not_true, false, not_false, bigger, lesser,
      pass, fail, throws, exits, error.

    - docs for existing checks
   
    - unregister stats counter process correctly
    
0.4 - adding checks & do more applied testing

    - suppress the default suite's dump

0.5 - make sense of suite concurrency

0.6 - asynchronous server tests

    - internal: possibly refactor suite_lop, remove counter
    
    - make verbosity and debug flags consistent

0.7 - more doc

0.8 - mount and unmount suite/check environment
