Erlunit 0.1

Simple Test Suite tool for Erlang
---------------------------------

"I do use a form of micro testing that is built into Erlang." - Joe Armstrong

Joe Armstrong describes how you don't really need a test frame work in many 
situations, because the pattern matching in Erlang can be used for testing.

But if you'd still like to use something more, yet simple, this may be a start.

Note that this is not the 'Erlunit' that some web pages mentioned prior to 2010.
